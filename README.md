## Physics is more fun when you can see it working.

The majority of the projects were done using **Trinket** and **VPython**.

Trinket is a web-based platform that provides a variety of educational tools for programming and computer science education. 
It allows users to write, run, and share code snippets in a variety of programming languages including Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The platform is designed to be an easy-to-use and accessible environment for learning and teaching programming and computer science concepts.

VPython is a 3D graphics library for the Python programming language. It is specifically designed for scientific and educational purposes and 
provides a simple, intuitive way for users to create and manipulate 3D graphics and animations.
